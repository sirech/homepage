      I am a bit picky about the tools I use. Actually, I am 
      <b>
        very picky
      </b>
      . I cannot remember how many times I did rewrite my shell config in the past. It is problematic for pair programming because I usually am the only one that can work at my computer.

      Nowadays I try to at least outsource my configurations a bit, using some awesome community driven ones like 
      <a

      >
        Spacemacs
      </a>
       and 
      <a
        href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh"
      >
        Oh My Zsh
