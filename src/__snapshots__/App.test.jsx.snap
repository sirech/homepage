                I have been programming for a while already. Counting the time when I was studying, it has been over ten years already. If

                 I should know by now what I am doing, although I often get the feeling I don't know anything (which seems to be a widespread problem if you see the job applications we get).

                In this time I have been in a number of companies, mostly focused on web programming. I started as a developer, focused on backend topics. At some point I became frustrated having to wait for somebody else to implement the layouts, so I ended up learning HTML and CSS past the 
                <i>
                  random pixel assignment part
                </i>
                . I guess that qualifies me as a 
                <b>
                  Full Stack Developer
                </b>
                .

              <p
                className="card-text"
              >
                At some point somebody thought it was a good idea to make me the technical lead of a SCRUM team. I quickly discovered that it is not the same doing something yourself than helping somebody figure it out himself. I learned, somewhat to my surprise, that I really enjoy doing that, and that the people I have coached did as well. At least they don't tend to run away screaming from me, which is, I think, a good thing. Another consequence of this switch is that I have done a lot of interviewing in the last years.

                I used to hate talking in front of people. But I have done technical presentations for a while, and at some point I started to like it. Not that I have mastered, though. For instance, I still tend to talk too fast. I have mostly done technical presentations, at work and at ruby meetups. Hope to eventually get some experience with bigger crowds
